<h1>The Best Movies According to Suswagatam</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Godfather</h3>
<p>I liked the character of Don Vito Corleone the most.</p>

<h3>The Pianist</h3>
<p>
    I loved the scene where the protagonist was imitating playing the piano
    with his fingers in the air.
</p>

<h3>Manchester by the sea</h3>
<p>This movie has my heart. The portrayal of sorrow, grief, guilt, and everything inbetween is immaculate.</p>  

<h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>No words. Watch it.</p>

<h3>Midnight in Paris</h3>
<p>A heaven for a dreamer like me. I wish it had happened with me.</p>
